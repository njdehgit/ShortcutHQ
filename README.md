# ShortcutHQ
ShortcutHQ helps teams centralize and share important links as short, memorable paths (e.g., /go/ops/oncall). Create team-scoped shortcuts, invite members, control access, and track usage. Cut “where’s the link?” time, speed onboarding, and keep docs, dashboards, and tools one jump away.
